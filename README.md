# MyReads 

## Description 
This is one of the course projects from Udacity's React Nanodegree Program. MyReads is an app that allows the user to select
and categorize books he/she has read, is currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the
application and provides an API server and client library that the user will use to persist information as he/she interacts
with the application.
